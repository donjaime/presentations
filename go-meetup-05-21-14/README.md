## "A pragmatic look at the language design of Go."

This talk is basically a roll-up of some of the discussions I've had in the last year about Go's language design, and highlights some interesting consequences, design patterns, and tradeoffs. This isn't a deep dive on any one feature (like concurrency), but more of a tour of how the big pieces fit together, from the perspective of "getting actual work done", versus just ruminating about programming language design from an academic perspective.
